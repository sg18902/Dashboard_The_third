# Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is a data visualization dashboard built using React.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. The dashboard provides an interactive interface for visualizing various sales and customer data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Charting Library:** Highcharts
- **Styling:** Material-UI

## Environment Variables

For the frontend, you need to set the following environment variable:

- **`REACT_APP_API_URL`**: The base URL of the backend API.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Python installed on your machine.
- Git installed on your machine.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name/server
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the FastAPI server:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

   The server will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    ```

2. Install the required npm packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the client directory and add the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable:

    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

4. Run the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
